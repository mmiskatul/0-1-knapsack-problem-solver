A dynamic programming solution for the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**, implemented in Python (or your language). This solver computes the optimal selection of items (with given weights and values) to maximize total value without exceeding the knapsackâ€™s weight capacity. Includes a **web-based demo** for interactive use.

## Features
- **Dynamic Programming** â€“ Efficient pseudo-polynomial time solution (`O(nW)`).
- **Web Interface** â€“ Interactive demo hosted on Netlify ([try it here](https://knapsack-problem-solver.netlify.app/)).
- **Input Flexibility** â€“ Handles custom item lists and capacities.
- **Output Details** â€“ Returns:
  - Maximum achievable value.
  - Indices of selected items.
  - Total weight of the solution.

## Usage

### 1. Local Setup (Python)
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmiskatul/0-1-knapsack-problem-solver.git
   cd 0-1-knapsack-problem-solver
   ```

2. Run the solver:
   ```bash
   python knapsack.py
   ```
   *(Modify `knapsack.py` to input your items/capacity or use CLI arguments.)*

#### Example Input
```python
items = [
    {"weight": 2, "value": 3},
    {"weight": 3, "value": 4},
    {"weight": 4, "value": 5},
]
capacity = 5
```

#### Example Output
```
Maximum value: 7
Selected items: [0, 1]  (indices)
Total weight: 5
```

### 2. Web Demo
Visit the live demo to interactively solve the problem:

**How to use the web app**:
1. Enter item weights/values (comma-separated).
2. Set the knapsack capacity.
3. Click "Solve" to see the optimal solution.

## Algorithm
- **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp[i][w]`)**:
  - `i`: Number of items considered.
  - `w`: Current weight capacity.
  - `dp[i][w]`: Maximum value achievable with the first `i` items and capacity `w`.

- **Optimization**: Space complexity reduced to `O(W)` (1D array).
